* Press the button `Restart` in the lua window to restart the game
* Pause the game every time you have to save or load a state and hold `Shift` + `F(n)`/`F(n)` (ex. `Shift` + `F1` to save a state in slot 1) for some seconds, until you see the message `Saved State (n)`/`Loaded State (n)` appearing on the screen for less than a second
