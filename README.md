## Notes for mGBA scripts
* Be sure to enlarge enough the lua window to avoid text flickering or emulation lagging
* Every time you need to save or load a state, hold `Shift` + `(n)`/`(n)` (ex. `Shift` + `1` to save a state in slot 1 or `1` to load the state in slot 1) with game unpaused

## Notes for DeSmuMe scripts
* Everytime you need to restart the game, press the button `Restart` in the lua window
* Every time you need to save or load a state, pause the game and hold `Shift` + `F(n)`/`F(n)` (ex. `Shift` + `F1` to save a state in slot 1 or `F1` to load the state in slot 1) for some seconds, until you see the message `Saved State (n)`/`Loaded State (n)` appearing on the screen for less than a second
